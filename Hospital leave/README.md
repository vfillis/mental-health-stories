# "I didn't get any leave at all" â€” mental health patients unable to leave hospital when pandemic hit
**The pandemic has led to reductions in the leave patients were granted from mental health wards. Although lockdown restrictions have been easing, leave is still behind pre-pandemic levels.**

The article was published on 31 August 2021 and can be read [here]().

## Data analysis and visualisation

The story is based on data from Freedom of Information requests sent to NHS mental health trusts in England. 

Out of 51 trusts that received the request, 35 trusts provided data on hospital leave. 

But, the trusts record leave data differently. Data from 10 trusts was excluded because they either provided the number of leave days instead of instances of leave or the number of patients who had at least one day of leave per month. Two trusts were only able to report on yearly figures.

Therefore, only data from 23 trusts was analysed. 

Figures include home leave and leave of absence, although not all trusts were able to provide this breakdown and provided the total number of leaves instead.

The data can be found [here]().
