      <h1>About the project</h1>

      <p>Last year over 100,000 people in England were admitted to hospital for a mental health problem. The experiences they make in mental health wards varies from person to person. It depends on the trust and unit they are receiving care from.</p>
      <p>Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic and various lockdowns, mental health units were forced to adapt the way they operate.</p>
      <p>This is why I have started this project. My name is Vanessa Fillis and I am currently studying for an MA in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University. I have previously reported on inequalities in mental health services, for example how <a href="https://vfillis.github.io/html/mental-health-and-housing.html">thousands of mental health patients are experiencing homelessness</a>.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project I will look at activities in mental health wards, hospital leave, and inappropriate out of area placements. You can subscribe to my newsletter below to not miss anything. </p>
      <p>I firmly believe that there needs to be more awareness for mental illness and this is what I strive to achieve through my reporting.</p>

      <h3>Subscribe to my newsletter</h3>
      <p>As part of the project, I have started a newsletter around all things mental health. </p>
