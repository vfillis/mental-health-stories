        <h2>TITLE</h2>
        <p>subtitle</p>
        <p>By Vanessa Fillis, 14 August 2021</p>
      </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>When Hannah was detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to a mental health ward in June 2020 &mdash; in the middle of a global pandemic &mdash; she didn’t get any leave from the first hospital she was sent to. </p>
      <p>“It made me feel incredibly frustrated,” Hanna says and adds: “It’s so overwhelming being on the wards and wanting to get off them, just for a break from that environment.”</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“And if the leave was with staff, it was also about there being enough staff on the ward to be able to take you. If people were off sick and they were struggling with staff, then sometimes even if you were written up for leave, it was difficult to take leave.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>Because there were no beds available in her local area, Hannah was first sent to a hospital outside her area.</p>
      <p>After one week, she got transferred to a unit closer to her home. There, she did get some leave, but, compared to when she was inpatient before, it was less frequent and regular.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“How long and where you were actually allowed to go was more restricted because of the pandemic. I suppose to stop the spread of people going too far away.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>The <strong>Care Quality Commission (CQC)</strong> stressed the importance of leave in their report <em>Monitoring the Mental Health Act in 2019/20: The Mental Health Act in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</em>: </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“For most detained patients, leave is not simply an opportunity to spend time off the ward, but also a step towards eventual discharge from detention and a key part of rehabilitation.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>

      <h3>Covid on the wards: restrictions and safety measures</h3>
      <p>Like Hannah, patients on mental health wards in England were impacted by the introduction of Covid safety measures.</p>
      <p>Early on, <strong>NHS England and Improvement</strong> have issued guidance for Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and Autism Services on <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/covid-19-mh-lh-autism-cell-update-number-1-15-march-2020.pdf">responding to COVID-19</a> and <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0454-mhlda-spec-comm-legal-guidance-v2-19-may.pdf">supporting people of all ages during the pandemic</a>.</p>
      <p>In the latter, published in May 2020, they refer to the possibility of an increased use of blanket restrictions to maintain safe care where staffing levels are significantly impacted by Covid-19.</p>
      <p>However, they state that this should not impact Section 17 Leave. (What is Section 17 Leave)</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“Section 17 leave should still be made available to individuals where this is appropriate, particularly where it is an important part of discharge planning, while giving due consideration to the requirements on social distancing and the need to reduce risk of transmitting COVID-19.” <!-- The principles set out for managing section 17 leave for people detained under the MHA should also be followed to enable informal patients to access time off the ward where possible.--><br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>Similarly, the <strong>Royal College of Nursing (RCN)</strong> has developed <a href="file:///Users/vanessafillis/Downloads/COVID-19-Guidance-for-inpatient-mental-health-staff%20(3).pdf">guidance for inpatient mental health staff</a> in which they say that leave from the ward should be maintained.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“Patient leave from the ward, either escorted or unescorted, will require additional risk assessment depending on their exposure to symptoms. Where possible, leave and time off the ward should be maintained. If it is not possible this should be clearly communicated to the patient including the process for review.“<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>

      <p>Data obtained through Freedom of Information requests reveals that the patients' hospital leave has been <strong>significantly impacted</strong> by the pandemic with monthly instaces of granted leave dropping when the pandemic hit last year. But although national restrictions have been easing since March (?), the granted leave is only slowly picking up.</p>
      <p>32 mental health trusts in England have provided data on patients' hospital leave, out of 51 trusts that received the request.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/955053"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-1">At the end of May 2021, <strong>11,250 patients</strong> were inpatient in mental health wards in the trusts that provided data.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-2">Before the pandemic, there were on average <strong>more than 16,000 instances of leave</strong> each month.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-3">In February 2021, there were 16,228 instances of leave across mental health wards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-3">The data shows instances of leave that have started each month and can include the same patient more than once &mdash; if they got leave repeatedly.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-4">When the pandemic hit, trusts put restrictions in place which were affecting the patients' leave.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-5">As a result, the number of leaves dropped to <strong>under 7,000</strong> in April 2020 after the first lockdown was introduced.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-6">In the following months, the monthly number of leaves increased slightly.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-7">But local restrictions or new lockdowns &mdash; like in November 2020 and January 2021 &mdash; resulted once more in decreasing levels of leave.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-7">From 8 March 2021, the government started to lift restrictions as part of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown. During this time, hospital leave has increased each month.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-9">In May 2021, patients' on mental health wards were granted leave 9,938 times.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-9">Although an increase from previous months, the figure is still far behind pre-lockdown levels and even lower than the previous peak in August 2020. (Data: percentage difference to pre-lockdown in Feb20 - 39%).</a></p>

        <!-- box underneath the data vis -->
        <p class="data-infobox"><strong>About the data:</strong> X trusts provided data on hospital leave. Data from X trusts was excluded because they either provided yearly data or the number of leave days instead of instances of leave. Figures include home leave and leave of absences, but daily leave often not… (look up wording). </p>


        <p>Why is leave important?</p>
        <p>Quote CQC</p>


        <p>other vis: In some trusts the number of leave has recovered quicker / slower.</p>
        <p>other vis: kinds of leave?</p>
