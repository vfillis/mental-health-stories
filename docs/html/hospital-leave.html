        <h2>"I didn't get any leave at all" &mdash; </h2>
        <p>The pandemic has led to reductions in the leave patients were granted from mental health wards. Although lockdown restrictions have been easing, leave is still behind pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        <p>By Vanessa Fillis, 14 August 2021</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="content">
      <blockquote class="quote">“One of the most important things when I've been in hospital before is being able to go home and being able to test out being back in my flat. Without that it was very difficult to readjust to going home.”</blockquote>
      <p>Hannah* spent two months in hospital detained under the Mental Health Act in June and July last year, in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>
      <p>While she was there, she could not leave the hospital grounds for longer than half an hour.</p>
      <p>“How long and where you were actually allowed to go was more restricted because of the pandemic. I suppose to stop the spread of people going too far away,” Hannah says.</p>
      <p>Being able to leave the hospital is an important part of a patient’s recovery journey, says <strong>Jessica Slingsby</strong>, Modern Matron for Adult Mental Health Inpatient Services in <strong>Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust</strong>.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“People do need to recover and a part of that is assessing people in their home environment.”</blockquote>
      <p>The <strong>Care Quality Commission (CQC)</strong> stressed the importance of leave, especially for detained patients, in their report <em>Monitoring the Mental Health Act in 2019/20: The Mental Health Act in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</em>: </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“For most detained patients, leave is not simply an opportunity to spend time off the ward, but also a step towards eventual discharge from detention and a key part of rehabilitation.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>

      <h3>Covid on the wards: restrictions and safety measures</h3>
      <p>Like Hannah, patients on mental health wards in England were impacted by the introduction of Covid safety measures.</p>
      <p>Early on, <strong>NHS England and Improvement</strong> have issued guidance for Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and Autism Services on <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/covid-19-mh-lh-autism-cell-update-number-1-15-march-2020.pdf">responding to COVID-19</a> and <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0454-mhlda-spec-comm-legal-guidance-v2-19-may.pdf">supporting people of all ages during the pandemic</a>.</p>
      <p>In the latter, published in May 2020, they refer to the possibility of an increased use of blanket restrictions to maintain safe care where staffing levels are significantly impacted by Covid-19.</p>
      <p>However, they state that this should not impact Section 17 Leave. This is <strong>planned leave</strong> from hospital for patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. It is considered an important part of preparing patients for their discharge from hospital.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“Section 17 leave should still be made available to individuals where this is appropriate while giving due consideration to the requirements on social distancing and the need to reduce risk of transmitting COVID-19.” <!-- The principles set out for managing section 17 leave for people detained under the MHA should also be followed to enable informal patients to access time off the ward where possible.--><br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>Similarly, the <strong>Royal College of Nursing (RCN)</strong> has developed <a href="file:///Users/vanessafillis/Downloads/COVID-19-Guidance-for-inpatient-mental-health-staff%20(3).pdf">guidance for inpatient mental health staff</a> in which they say that leave from the ward should be maintained.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“Patient leave from the ward, either escorted or unescorted, will require additional risk assessment depending on their exposure to symptoms. Where possible, leave and time off the ward should be maintained. If it is not possible this should be clearly communicated to the patient including the process for review.“<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>

      <h3>Hospital leave falling when the pandemic hit</h3>
      <p>For the purpose of this investigation, we have sent <strong>Freedom of Information requests</strong> to all NHS mental health trusts in England asking for the number of leave events that have been granted to patients each month.</p>
      <p>35 trusts responded in time and provided data. However, due to the way trusts store the data, there were some inconsistencies. For accuracy, only figures from 23 trusts were used. <!--Trusts collect and store the data differently. Some trusts reported on leave days or on the number of patients that got leave at least once each month. Two trusts sent yearly data instead of a monthly breakdown. Only 23 trusts reported on the number of leave events. They are included in the following analysis.--></p>
      <p>The data reveals that, across all trusts, the patients' hospital leave has been <strong>significantly impacted</strong> by the pandemic with monthly instances of granted leave dropping when the pandemic hit last year.</p>

      <div id=”my-wrapper”>
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/970250"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-1">In ten NHS mental health trusts, the numbers of granted leave from their mental health wards have decreased by <strong>over 75 per cent</strong> between February 2020 and May 2020.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-1">The average across all trusts was a decrease of 62 per cent.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-1">When the pandemic hit, trusts were told to discharge patients when possible to free up bed capacity.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-2">While this led to a decreases in the number of inpatients between February 2020 and May 2020 in eight of the trusts, the decrease was not as severe as the drop in leave.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-3">In two of the trusts, the number of inpatients even increased in the same period.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-4">In the trusts where leave decreased the most, the number of granted leave instances in May 2020 varied from <strong>as little as three</strong> in Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust to <strong>434</strong> in Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-4">The kind of leave the trusts included in the data differs.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-5">For two trusts, the data includes only overnight leave. That means that patients leaving the ward for only a few hours are not included in the data.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-6">For four trusts, the figures also include leave during the day with a length of less than a day.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-7">The other trusts did not specify whether the data they provided included leave with a length of less than a full day.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/970250/slide-4">In addition, some trusts stated that ad hoc leave would not be included in the data but only in a patient's notes.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-1">In four trusts, leave levels were already relatively low before the pandemic, with less than 160 instances of leave in February 2020.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-2">Three months later, they dropped to below 25.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-3">Across all trusts that provided data, leave decreased on average by 53 per cent between May 2019 and May 2020. </a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-2"><strong>Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust</strong> has seen the biggest drop in leave &mdash; from over 5,000 instances of granted leave in May 2019 to only 236 one year later.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-3">In two trusts leave has even <strong>increased slightly</strong> in that time period. It is important to note that the figures are relatively small in these trusts.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/961225/slide-4">In Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, leave has more or less stayed the same even in the pandemic.</a></p>

        </div>

        <!-- box underneath the data vis -->
        <p class="data-infobox"><strong>About the data:</strong> 35 trusts provided data on hospital leave, out of 51 that received the request. The requests showed that trusts record leave data differently. Data from 10 trusts was excluded because they either provided the number of leave days instead of instances of leave or the number of patients who had at least one day of leave per month. Two trusts were only able to report on yearly figures. <br>Figures include home leave and leave of absence, although not all trusts were able to provide this breakdown and provided the total number of leaves instead. <!-- Home leave occurs when an inpatient who is not detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 spends a period of time outside the hospital with the intention of returning to the ward. Leave of absence only applies to detained inpatients. The granted period of absence from hospital can be for any specified period and be escorted or unescorted. Not all trusts were able to provide this breakdown and could only provide a total number of leaves per month. -->
        </p>

        <h3>Patients unable to leave the ward</h3>
        <p>When Hannah was detained, she was first sent to another hospital out of her area because no beds were available in her local trust.</p>
        <p>There, she did not get any leave at all. During her one-week-long stay, she could not leave the ward &mdash; not even for a walk.</p>
        <p>“It made me feel incredibly frustrated,” Hannah says</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s so overwhelming being on the wards and wanting to get off them, just for a break from that environment.”</blockquote>
        <p>After one week, she got transferred to a unit closer to her home. There, she did get some leave, but, compared to when she was inpatient before, it was less frequent and regular.</p>
        <p>Especially, if leave was escorted, which means with a member of staff, it was dependant on the availability of staff, Hannah says: “It was also about there being enough staff on the ward to be able to take you. If people were off sick and they were struggling with staff, then sometimes even if you were written up for leave, it was difficult to take leave.”</p>

        <p><strong>Mad Covid</strong> is a service user led group that formed in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their aim is to bring together the voices of people with lived experience to influence change in real time. In November 2020, they have published a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q4M5meTesDBLlDs12m_eV4JILtG4dSA2/view">series of recommendations for mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>
        <p>In their report, a service user describes their experiences with leave when they were admitted to hospital during the pandemic:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We’re on lockdown, so there's no leave and no visitors and haven’t been for 4 weeks now. That’s had a huge negative impact, because I kind of just want to see my mum. Also not being able to go on leave means not being able to go for a walk. I'm sleeping a lot worse because I’m not getting any exercise, and it’s also going to be very difficult getting discharged when I haven't been outside in four weeks.”</blockquote>

        <!--
        <p>Jessica Slingsby says that in her trust, patients were still able to have access to their daily exercise, even in the height of the first lockdown.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“A lot of our patients chose to go out for a walk because that’s really important to them. Maybe they couldn’t go to the shopping centre because it was shut, but part of their recovery was getting out for some fresh air every day. That’s important for everybody isn’t it? Rather than being cooped up.”</blockquote> -->

        <h3>What trusts are saying</h3>
        <p>A spokesperson from <strong>Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust</strong> said that, as part of their response to minimise the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, they took "the difficult decision to restrict patient leave and visiting to ensure patients and staff could remain as safe as possible".</p>
        <p>As an alternative to leave, the wards were encouraged to make full use of outdoor spaces such as gardens and courtyards as well as introduce extra activities.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">"Due to the level of the virus in the community, we are re-introducing leave in-line with patient recovery plans. This means patients who need to take leave in order to support them with their recovery will be able to as long as social distancing, hand hygiene and mask wearing guidance is followed."</blockquote>


        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7116001"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>In <strong>Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust</strong>, instances of leave dropped by 263 between February and May 2020. A spokesperson said: "For Derbyshire Healthcare, the protection and safety of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a priority. At the same time, the Trust has recognised the importance of supporting those using our inpatient services with their recovery."</p>
        <p>Due to social distancing measures, the trust saw a drop in useable acute beds and instead introduced new treatment options in the community.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“As a result of these developments, the patients that were admitted to Trust inpatient facilities tended to be those with more acute mental ill health, which meant that it took longer for them to be in a position where it was suitable for them to have leave.“<p>“There were additional issues around the continuing need for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and for people to isolate for 14 days at a time, which led to longer periods before leave could start across all inpatient areas. Due to the risk of infection, periods of leave were extended to prevent the risk of community infection into the ward areas. This meant that, although there were fewer leaves arranged, the average leave tended to be longer in duration.<p>“As national restrictions have reduced over summer 2021, the processes to enable usual service user leave have started to resume and we are seeing a return to more normal levels of leave.”</blockquote>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7116088"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <h3>Almost at pre-pandemic levels</h3>
        <p>In four trusts, leave was almost back at or above pre-pandemic levels in May 2021.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7116153"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>A spokesperson at <strong>Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust</strong> said:“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic our teams have continued to adapt how our services are delivered so our service users get the care and support they need in a safe environment. As increased infection prevention measures were introduced, our inpatient wards saw reduced levels of leave.”
        <blockquote class="quote">“We recognise that leave is often a very important part of an individual’s pathway through our services and we have carefully considered the effects of adapting and reducing leave while ensuring there continue to be opportunities to maintain contact with friends and family using other means such as video calls. This resulted in fewer occurrences of short leave and overnight leave than may have historically been used to test an individuals readiness for discharge.</blockquote>
        <p>With national restrictions easing, the trust has <strong>gradually reintroduced leave</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“Our services will continue to adapt to the easing of restrictions moving forward and with that we expect to see levels of leave increasing. Taking on board learnings from the pandemic and continually improving our services, we also expect leave may be used in slightly different ways going forwards with increased input from community services.”</blockquote>


        <!--
        <h3>Trusts still behind pre-lockdown levels</h3>
        <p>The data can also give an indication on how trusts are lifting restrictions and re-introducing leave. But although national restrictions have been easing since March, the granted leave is only slowly picking up.</p>
        <p>In 10 trusts, leave was over 40 per cent behind pre-lockdown levels in May 2021, compared to May 2019. This is almost half of the trusts that provided data.</p>
        <p>“Some services continued to uphold restrictions on patients’ movement, activities and leave for longer than seemed necessary, which we saw could have an adverse impact on patients’ wellbeing,” is also what the Care Quality Commission found in their report Monitoring the Mental Health Act in 2019/20. (link) </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“Services should recognise the significant impact restrictions on leave of absence and activity can have on detained patients and ensure these are lifted as quickly and as safely possible to avoid very damaging ‘closed cultures’ from emerging.”</blockquote>
        <p>In four trusts, the leave has been slow to pick up and is still over 80 per cent behind pre-pandemic levels.</p>

        <div id=”my-wrapper”>
          <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/961092"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-1">In Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, the number of leaves that patients were granted dropped from 151 in February 2020 to 22 in April and May after the pandemic hit.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-2">Less leave was only recorded in January 2021.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-3">Although the figure has increased slightly since then, the number of leave events is still far off from pre-pandemic levels. </a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-3">In May 2021, <strong>84 per cent less leave</strong> has been recorded compared to May 2019. </a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-4">A similar pattern can be seen in Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust with leave dropping to almost zero in June 2020.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-4">With only seven instances of leave granted in May 2021, the trust recorded <strong>89 per cent less leave</strong> than before the pandemic in May 2019.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-5">In Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, leave already decreased in 2019 before the pandemic.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-5">Numbers of leave still fell from 38 in February 2020 to under 10 in April and May the same year.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-5">Apart from a small peak in October 2020, leave has stayed low, 96 per cent behind pre-pandemic levels.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-6">The drop in Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust was the highest across all trusts.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-6">It went up slightly in the second half of 2020 before falling again in line with the third lockdown in January 2021.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/961092/slide-6">Subsequently, levels of leave were 95 per cent behind pre-pandemic levels in May 2021.</a></p>

        <h3>A trust going into business continuity</h3>
        <p>When the pandemic hit, trusts were forced to react immediately.</p>
        <p>It was the second or third week in March 2020 when the executive management team of <strong>Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust</strong> made the decision to go into business continuity, <strong>Adrian Elsworth</strong> remembers. </p>
        <p>Only a week later, the first national lockdown was announced.</p>

        <!-- image Adrian Elsworth -->
        <div class="image-adrian-elsworth">

        </div>

        <p>Adrian Elsworth is <strong>Unplanned Care General Manager</strong> for the Mental Health Division in Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
        <p>The following months were marked by the policies and procedures that are to be followed in a business continuity position. <strong>Business continuity</strong> means having a plan to deal with difficult situations, so that an organisation can continue to function with as little disruption as possible.</p>
        <p>This especially meant following government guidelines and practices around <strong>infection prevention and control</strong> as well as putting measures in place.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the trust, they were in the process of permanently closing a unit &mdash; which then was transformed into a <strong>designated Covid area</strong>. </p>
        <p>“I think we were one of rare trusts within the UK that actually created a designated covid area for mental health service users,” Adrian says. </p>

        <h3>Designated Covid unit and regular testing</h3>
        <p>Within a fortnight of being altered to the pandemic, 24 beds were available for patients. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We almost refilled the unit that we had almost closed as well as moving a large staff team into that area to support those service users. That enabled us to deliver a Covid-related care for mental health presentations.<p>“Designing that area enabled us to be able to manage the spread of infection and the safety of our patients in a very different way.”</p></blockquote>
        <p>Because of the benefits, the unit has been kept to this date, although smaller in size. The last Covid mental health patient was in the unit a few weeks ago. But, Adrian says, the unit will remain in situ until such a time that nationally there is no longer a need for it. </p>

        <!-- image Jessica Slingsby -->

        <p><strong>Jessica Slingsby</strong>, nurse matron in Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust, adds: “We are one of the last remaining trusts from a mental health point of view that have designated Covid areas.”</p>
        <p>Additionally, the trust has introduced testing on all admissions, enabling them to identify cases and limiting the wider impact on the unit they were admitted to. </p>
        <p>“We do weekly testing on all our wards now, so in that sense we’re on top of it all the time in testing and ensuring people that we are covid safe and Covid secure,” Jessica says.</p>
        <p>Because of these measures, Jessica says, there have been very few occasions where they had to close their main wards due to a Covid outbreak &mdash; which directly affects the patients' leave. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote"><!--“We’ve sort of been able to continue as best we can.<p>-->“Patients have seen what happens when their leave ends up getting restricted and how that’s not conducive for their recovery. People have been there when that’s happened and then they’ve seen what we’re trying to do, that we trying to not shut the wards. I think it’s had an overall benefit and an all-round positive outcome for both patients and staff.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Learnings over the pandemic</h3>
        <p>“We were in a state of not knowing” &mdash; this is how Jessica describes the initial reaction to the pandemic. </p>
        <p>Following government guidelines, she experienced a steep learning curve in the first lockdown. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We’ve never faced this before but over the last 17 months we’ve really come a long way and worked really hard to ensure that as much as possible Covid isn’t impacting on our wards.”</blockquote>
        <p>This included basic measures like encouraging patient isolation upon admission, wearing masks, and reducing bed capacity to ensure social distancing between patients, but also more creative procedures.</p>
        <p>In regard to visiting, the trust created special outside areas where patients could meet with their visitors &mdash; instead of being on the wards.</p>
        <p>Being in full PPE &mdash; in mask, goggles, gloves, aprons &mdash; all the time is not helpful for the communication with patients, Jessica says about another area where they came up with creative innovations. </p>
        <p>“We called them PPE pocket packs,” Jessica says. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We had masks on and tried to socially distance. But if we needed to put full PPE on because we needed to intervene because of various reasons, we had them in our pockets, so we could quickly put them on.”</blockquote>
        <p>This meant staff weren’t walking around in full PPE all the time “because that’s not helpful and it’s not nice for staff either”.</p>
        <p>Their innovations around infection prevention and control did not go unnoticed. Recently, the trust was <a href="https://awards.nursingtimes.net/2021-shortlist">shortlisted for the Nursing Times Award</a>.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We’ve really tried to be innovative in how we’re working together with staff and service users to try and make this the least impact that we could possibly make.”</blockquote>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-1">At the end of May 2021, <strong>11,190 patients</strong> were inpatient in mental health wards in the trusts that provided data.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-2">In the six months before the pandemic, there were on average <strong>more than 19,000 instances of leave</strong> each month.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-3">In February 2021, there were 18,965 instances of leave across mental health wards.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-3">The data shows instances of leave that have started each month and can include the same patient more than once &mdash; if they got leave repeatedly.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-4">When the pandemic hit, the number of leaves dropped.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-5">After the first lockdown was introduced, instaces of leaves dropped to <strong>under 7,000</strong> in April 2020 &mdash; the lowest point throughout the pandemic.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-6">In the following months, the monthly number of leaves increased each month until October 2020.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-7">Local restrictions or new lockdowns &mdash; like in November 2020 and January 2021 &mdash; resulted once more in decreasing levels of leave.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-7">From 8 March 2021, the government started to lift restrictions as part of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown. Since then, hospital leave has increased each month.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-9">In May 2021, patients' on mental health wards were granted leave 9,938 times.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/955053/slide-9">Although an increase from previous months, the figure is still far behind pre-lockdown levels and lower than the previous peak in August 2020. (Data: percentage difference to pre-lockdown in Feb20 - 39%).</a></p>
