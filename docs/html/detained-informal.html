    <div class="content">
      <p>Last year, Hannah* was detained under the Mental Health Act. Because there weren't any beds available, she had to spend  24 hours in a Section 136 cell &mdash; although she was under a Section 2.</p>
      <p>A Section 2 is used if someone needs to be detained for a short time for assessment and medical treatment. Under Section 2, someone can be detained for up to 28 days. </p>
      <p>Although being under Section 2, Hannah was sent to a Section 136 suite &mdash; a facility for people who are detained by the police under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It is supposed to provide a place of safety while assessments are carried out.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“I wasn’t on a 136, but there were no beds, so they had to put me in a 136 which is like a cell basically. It’s just got a plastic bed and they took all my clothes off me and put me in ligature proof clothes, and it got a little camera in the corner. It was horrible. I had to stay there for 24 hours because there were no beds.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>Since 1988, the number of mental health beds has decreased by <strong>74 per cent</strong>.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956136"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-1">In 1987/1988, <strong>67,122 beds</strong> were available for mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-2">In the following 33 years, the number of beds has fallen by <strong>almost 50,000 beds</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-3">In 2020/2021, only on average <strong>17,610 beds</strong> were left.</a></p>

      </div>

      <p>On average, every day <strong>82 per cent</strong> of these beds were <strong>occupied</strong> in 2020/2021.</p>

      <p>To maintain patient safety standards, <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10288-001-Emergency-admissions.pdf">bed occupancy should not exceed 85 per cent</a>. A higher bed occupancy leads to regular bed shortages. These are impacting patient care as directing patients to the bed most suitable for their care is less likely to be possible.</p>

      <p>Data obtained through Freedom of Information requests reveals that while the national average was below 85 per cent, individual mental health trusts are <strong>operating at higher occupancy rates</strong>.</p>



      <!-- Flourish scrollytelling -->
      <div id=”my-wrapper”>
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956231"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-1">Out of 34 trusts that replied to the request, only five trusts had bed occupancy rates below 85 per cent on a day in June 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-2">29 trusts had rates over 85 per cent.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-3">This means the majority of trusts was operating at levels that should not be exceeded to maintain patient safety standards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-4">Out of the trusts exceeding the recommended occupancy rates, five trusts had rates ranging between 85% and 90%.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-5">In 11 trusts, between 90 and 95 per cent of beds were occupied by mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-6">In nine trusts almost all beds were occupied.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-7">And in four trusts bed occupancy even <strong>exceeded 100 per cent</strong> &mdash; meaning some beds were occupied by more than one patient that day.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-8">This happens when one patient is on leave and during that time the bed is given to a new patient, says an Approved Mental Health Professional.</a></p>

      </div>


        <h3>What the lack of beds means for detentions</h3>
        <p>If there is no bed available, then a patient cannot be detained, says an <strong>Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP)</strong> who does not want to be named.</p>
        <p>AMHPs are trained to use the Mental Health Act. They carry out assessments and help decide if someone should be detained.</p>
        <p>“The tricky thing is the AMHP can’t make the application to detain a patient until the NHS tells the AMHP where the bed is,” the AMHP says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“If there is no bed, they are not detained. No one is detained until the AMHP makes the application.<p>“This means the person is free to go about their business. And that’s a real problem sometimes.”</p></blockquote>
        <p>For example, if AMHP accesses someone in the community in their house but cannot detain them because of a lack of beds, he has to ask them to let him back in later since he has no power of entry.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“How would you feel about that? I’m telling you I’m going to detain you but I have to leave, so please let me back in later and until then keep yourself safe and don’t bother anybody.<p>“It doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t feel ideal. I always describe the system as being dysfunctional and difficult to navigate.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Bed manager / giving beds based on risk</h3>
        <p>Every mental health trust has a <strong>bed manager</strong> who knows how many people are being assessed and waiting to come in. </p>
        <p>“They will rate the risk of people and they will prioritise the beds to those that they consider to be the most at risk to themselves or others,” the AMHP says.</p>
        <p>“If someone is more risky, they are more likely to get a bed quicker,” is also what <strong>Helen Rees</strong> is experiencing. She is a <strong>mental health nurse</strong> working with 0 to 25-year-olds in the community. </p>
        <p>For her, the lack of beds means that it has gotten harder for informal patients to access inpatient support when they need it. She says: “The service that we are offering is increasingly becoming risk-based management.”</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“You could be really highly distressed and suffering and have an illness that is impacting your life and health outcomes but unless there are significant risks and that kind of threshold is met, getting an inpatient bed is really difficult.”</blockquote>
        <p>As a result, people are being left without inpatient support for longer, Helen says &mdash; until they get into the position where those risks are there. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We are having to nurse people to a point in the community where if they got that level of help earlier then they wouldn't get to that riskier stage. But we are having to let people get to that riskier stage because we just can't access inpatient beds in the way we would like to.”</blockquote>

        <h3>How a lack of beds impacts admissions</h3>
        <p>With the lack of beds and the difficulties accessing inpatient care, those who are in hospital at the moment are considerably unwell, AMHP says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“The acuity of people on wards is severe at the moment – it means that everybody is unwell, disturbed or distressed.”</blockquote>
        <p>AMHP draws up two scenarios. One where 50 per cent of patients on the ward are detained and 50 per cent are there voluntarily. He would imagine the latter to be less unwell and less distressed.</p>
        <p>In the other scenario, 85 per cent of people on the wards are detained and severely unwell.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“That’s a very difficult place for other people to be and live in. You might have people very distressed, showing positive symptoms of mental disorder, responding to voices, and being actively suicidal. Staff might have to intervene and do restraints and forced medication. You wouldn’t describe that as a therapeutic environment.”</blockquote>
        <p>In 2011, a report by the charity <strong>MIND</strong> <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4377/listening_to_experience_web.pdf">has found that 39 per cent of people in hospital were detained under the Mental Health Act</a>.</p>
        <p>Back then <strong>NHS Digital</strong> said in their <a href="https://files.digital.nhs.uk/publicationimport/pub02xxx/pub02179/ment-heal-bull-four-repo-m-h-m-d-2010-rep.pdf">Mental Health Bulletin</a>: “This suggests that NHS psychiatric hospitals are increasingly used to care for and contain people who are seriously mentally ill and who are considered to pose a risk to themselves or others.”</p>
        <p>Ten years later, the ratio of detained patients in wards is considerably higher.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="100vh" data-src="story/954111"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-1">At the end of March 2021, <strong>19,372 patients</strong> were inpatient in adult mental health wards in England.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-2">With 16,030 patients, the majority was admitted to <strong>NHS hospitals</strong>. Just over 3,000 were placed in <strong>private hospitals</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-3">For around half of the patients in NHS institutions, a classification into their status as a patient is available through Freedom of Information requests sent to NHS mental health trusts. 33 trusts provided the requested data.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-4">If a patient is in a mental health hospital voluntarily, this is called an <strong>informal admission</strong>. </a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-5">At the end of May 2021, there were <strong>2,834 informal patients</strong> in adult mental health wards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">But the majority of patients was <strong>detained under the Mental Health Act</strong> with 6,408 at the end of May 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">Someone can be detained if professionals think their mental health puts them or others at risk. They can be taken to hospital and be kept there against their wishes.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-7">At the end of May 2021, detained patients made up <strong>69%</strong> of the total inpatient count.</a></p>

        </div>

        <h3>Trusts with high detained patient rates</h3>
        <p>In 2018, the <strong>Care Quality Commission</strong> published a <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20180123_mhadetentions_report.pdf">report on the rise in the use of the Mental Health Act to detain people in England</a>.</p>
        <p>They found that some NHS wards would only submit people if they were subject to the Act. With bed occupancy exceeding 100% in some areas, even patients requiring an admission under section 2 might experience delays.</p>
        <p>The data shows regional/local differences in the ratio of detained to informal patients on the wards.</p>

        <p>other vis: In some trusts the number of detained patients is even higher/the ratio of detained patients is even higher.</p>

        <!-- Flourish scrollytelling -->
        <div id=”my-wrapper”>
          <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="100vh" data-src="story/x"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

          <p><a href="#story/x/slide-1">In some trusts, eight out of ten patients on the ward were detained at the end of May 2021, obtained data shows.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/x/slide-2">With 16,030 patients, the majority was admitted to <strong>NHS hospitals</strong>. Just over 3,000 were placed in <strong>private hospitals</strong>.</a></p>

          <p><a href="#story/x/slide-3">For around half of the patients in NHS institutions, a classification into their status as a patient is available through Freedom of Information requests sent to NHS mental health trusts. 33 trusts provided the requested data.</a></p>

        <h3>What happens when there is no bed?</h3>
        <p>When no bed is available for a patient, they have to be treated in the community/the responsibility falls to the community teams.</p>
        <p>From Helen’s experience, the team would work closely with an individual to produce a suitable care package. </p>
        <p>That could be home treatment going in regularly, it could be the use of the crisis team who can provide a response, or it could be thinking about some of the Talking Therapies and helping someone access them.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think the most important thing we would do is provide that therapeutic relationship, that acknowledgment that we are there for that individual, that unconditional positive regard as well as advocating for them and pushing for the access to the services they need.”</blockquote>
        <p>However, Helen is experiencing restrictions on what she can do on a community-basis. This is mainly due to an increased demand for community services with referrals going up significantly. </p>
        <p>“The referrals are so overwhelming at the moment,” Helen says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I'm probably telling ideal world scenarios. Whether people would actually get that in reality would depend on how busy the particular service was where they lived.”</blockquote>
        <p>data: referrals going up</p>
        <p>Hannah has experienced stretched community services.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s hard to get help initially and then it’s hard to keep that help. Everything is time-limited and you sort of move from service to service. There is definitely not enough support in the community at all.”</blockquote>

        <h3>Waiting for an admission</h3>
        <p>If no bed is available, it can be that a patient is sent home until a bed comes up.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Hannah agreed to be admitted informally &mdash; but because there was no bed available, she was sent back to her flat where she was living on her own. </p>
        <p>“I've ended up waiting for days for a bed at home,” she says and adds: “And that's just once you've made the decision that you agree to this.”</p>
        <p>Finding hospitals difficult, it was a big deal for Hannah to agree to go in informally. Being told that no bed is available and sent back home to wait, made the situation even harder for her. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It was horrible. Obviously you're acutely unwell and you're completely in it and the stress of saying yes, I will go in when you don't really want to go in and then suddenly having that weight of just waiting.<p>“Usually they put you under the crisis team and the crisis team visits you every day, but that's half an hour out of a day and the rest of the time is just like sitting, waiting for the call to say that there’s a bed and not knowing where that bed will be as well.” </p></blockquote>

        <h3>Waiting lists for admissions</h3>
        <p>The majority of trusts do not operate a waiting list for admissions. Out of 36 trusts that replied to a FOI about this matter, eight trusts (22%) were operating a waiting list. At the end of June 2021, 351 patients in these trusts were waiting for a bed. </p>
        <p>The longest time a patient on the lists has been waiting for an admission is <strong>288 days</strong> in <strong>Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust</strong>. On average, patients in that trust have been waiting for 28 days for a bed.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust</strong>, one patient has already been waiting for <strong>272 days</strong> &mdash; 2.5 times the average waiting time of 111 days.</p>
        <p>The shortest waiting times have been recorded in <strong>Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust</strong> where patients have been waiting on average 3 hours until they got admitted.</p>
        <p>Trusts that were not able to report on this data often said that a bed will be found when a person needs to be admitted. <strong>Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust</strong> referred to their Crisis Response Home Treatment Teams that can support patients in the community.</p>
        <p>Trusts admitted that “patients will occasionally be placed out of area if no bed is available locally”.</p>
        <p>This is despite the national ambition of eliminating inappropriate Out of Area Placements by the end of March 2021 &mdash; a deadline that has passed by now.</p>
        <p>data: OAPs + trusts new deadlines & plans (FOI)</p>
        <p>Hannah: placed out of area</p>



        <h3>More beds, more staff, more early intervention</h3>
        <p>When Helen talks about her role, she describes reducing coercion and restriction and co-producing care as key parts. Not being able to provide the right support at the right time leads to a risk of moral injury, she says. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think that because we can't get beds when people are willing to go informally, there's a real risk of moral injury there because we can't support people in the way that we would like to -  which would be in a least coercive, informal way.”</blockquote>
        <p>Moral injury leads in part to high turnover of staff which affects the delivered care. </p>
        <p>Therefore, Helen would like to see community services that are commissioned and designed by nurses and people with lived experience. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think you need to ask the people that deliver the care, which is the nurses and the people who receive the care and design some really high quality, well-staffed, well-funded community services that are what people need.”</blockquote>
        <p>By that, Helen specifies, she does not mean home treatment and crisis teams, but services that support patients before they get into a period of distress. </p>
        <p>To reduce restrictive care, Helen says more beds in the NHS are needed. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“Trusts need to have a responsibility not to place people out of areas and to do that, they need to access beds. And I'm completely committed to people receiving care in the community. That is what we would all want and that's what patients want when it's safe to do so. But we can't avoid the fact that not everybody can stay well through community services alone. Some people are going to need inpatient care in order to stay well and they can't do that unless there are more beds.”</blockquote>

        <h3>AMHP title</h3>
        <p>AHMP has been working as an AMHP for over 20 years now. When he started his job, there were more beds, more provision, more (?). </p>
        <p>He has met and assessed thousands of people, walked alongside them on a tiny bit of their journey in life. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s a privilege to be invited into people’s lives at sometimes the lowest point. Sometimes people like me literally save your life. It doesn’t feel like that, but we actually save people’s lives. And sometimes we fail.”</blockquote>
        <p>Over time, the job has become more challenging. “It’s hugely frustrating at times because it feels as if you’re fighting against the system.”</p>
        <p>He was party to the Mental Health Act review which … (might lead to changes?). For him, the Act himself isn’t the problem. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s the lack of provision, it’s the lack of early intervention, it’s the lack of tackling the social determinants of health, it’s the lack of beds, it’s the lack of investment – it’s mental health services being underinvested in for decades and decades. And it cannot meet the demand that has been placed upon it.” </blockquote>




        <!-- box underneath the data vis
        <p class="data-infobox"><strong>About the data:</strong> (source: FOI to NHS Trusts…) + Not all services are required to record the patient's accommodation status.
