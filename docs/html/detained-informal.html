    <div class="content">
      <p>Last year, Hannah was detained under the Mental Health Act. Because there weren't any beds available, she had to spend  24 hours in a Section 136 cell &mdash; although she was under a Section 2.</p>
      <p>A Section 2 is used if someone needs to be detained for a short time for assessment and medical treatment. Under Section 2, someone can be detained for up to 28 days. </p>
      <p>Although being under Section 2, Hannah was sent to a Section 136 suite &mdash; a facility for people who are detained by the police under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It is supposed to provide a place of safety while assessments are carried out.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“I wasn’t on a 136, but there were no beds, so they had to put me in a 136 which is like a cell basically. It’s just got a plastic bed and they took all my clothes off me and put me in ligature proof clothes, and it got a little camera in the corner. It was horrible. I had to stay there for 24 hours because there were no beds.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>Since 1988, the number of mental health beds has decreased by <strong>74 per cent</strong>.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956136"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-1">In 1987/1988, <strong>67,122 beds</strong> were available for mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-2">In the following 33 years, the number of beds has fallen by <strong>almost 50,000 beds</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-3">In 2020/2021, only on average <strong>17,610 beds</strong> were left.</a></p>

      </div>

      <p>On average, every day <strong>82 per cent</strong> of these beds were <strong>occupied</strong> in 2020/2021.</p>

      <p>To maintain patient safety standards, <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10288-001-Emergency-admissions.pdf">bed occupancy should not exceed 85 per cent</a>. A higher bed occupancy leads to regular bed shortages. These are impacting patient care as directing patients to the bed most suitable for their care is less likely to be possible.</p>

      <p>Data obtained through Freedom of Information requests reveals that while the national average was below 85 per cent, individual mental health trusts are <strong>operating at higher occupancy rates</strong>.</p>



      <!-- Flourish scrollytelling -->

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956231"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-1">Out of 34 trusts that replied to the request, only five trusts had bed occupancy rates below 85 per cent on a day in June 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-2">29 trusts had rates over 85 per cent.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-3">This means the majority of trusts was operating at levels that should not be exceeded to maintain patient safety standards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-4">Out of the trusts exceeding the recommended occupancy rates, five trusts had rates ranging between 85% and 90%.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-5">In 11 trusts, between 90 and 95 per cent of beds were occupied by mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-6">In nine trusts almost all beds were occupied.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-7">And in four trusts bed occupancy even <strong>exceeded 100 per cent</strong> &mdash; meaning some beds were occupied by more than one patient that day.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-8">This happens when one patient is on leave and during that time the bed is given to a new patient, says an Approved Mental Health Professionals.</a></p>

      </div>


        <h3>What the lack of beds means for detentions</h3>
        <p>If there is no bed available, then a patient cannot be detained, says an <strong>Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP)</strong> who does not want to be named.</p>
        <p>AMHPs are mental health professionals who are training to use the Mental Health Act. They carry out assessments and help decide if someone should be detained under the Mental Health Act.</p>
        <p>“The tricky thing is the AMHP can’t make the application to detain a patient until the NHS tells the AMHP where the bed is,” the AMHP says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“If there is no bed, they are not detained. No one is detained until the AMHP makes the application.<p>“This means the person is free to go about their business. And that’s a real problem sometimes.”</p></blockquote>
        <p>For example, if an AMHP accesses someone in the community in their house and he cannot detain them because of a lack of beds, he has to ask them to let him back in later because he has no power of entry.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“How would you feel about that? I’m telling you I’m going to detain you but I have to leave, please let me back in and keep yourself safe and don’t bother anybody.<p>“It doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t feel ideal. So I always describe the system as being dysfunctional and difficult to navigate.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Bed manager / giving beds based on risk</h3>
        <p>Every mental health trust has a <strong>bed manager</strong> who knows how many people are being assessed and are waiting to come in &mdash; and also how many people are in out of area placements. </p>
        <p>“They will rate the risk of people and they will prioritise the beds to those that they consider to be the most at risk to themselves or others,” the AMHP says.</p>
        <p>“If someone is more risky, they are more likely to get a bed quicker,” is also what <strong>Helen Rees</strong> is experiencing. She is a mental health nurse working with 0 to 25-year-olds in the community. </p>
        <p>For her, the lack of beds means that it has gotten harder for informal patients to access inpatient support when they need it. She says: “The service that we are offering is increasingly becoming risk-based management.”</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“You could be really highly distressed and suffering and have an illness that is impacting your life and health outcomes but unless there are significant risks and that kind of threshold is met, getting an inpatient bed is really, really difficult.”</blockquote>
        <p>As a result, people are being left without inpatient support for longer, Helen says &mdash; until they get into the position where those risks are there. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We are having to nurse people to a point in the community where if they got that level of help earlier then they wouldn't get to that riskier stage. But we are having to let people get to that riskier stage because we just can't access inpatient beds in the way we would like to.”</blockquote>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="100vh" data-src="story/954111"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-1">At the end of March 2021, <strong>19,372 patients</strong> were inpatient in adult mental health wards in England.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-2">With 16,030 patients, the majority was admitted to <strong>NHS hospitals</strong>. Just over 3,000 were placed in <strong>private hospitals</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-3">For around half of the patients in NHS institutions, a classification into their status as a patient is available through Freedom of Information requests sent to NHS mental health trusts. 33 trusts provided the requested data.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-4">If a patient is in a mental health hospital voluntarily, this is called an informal admission. </a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-5">At the end of May 2021, there were <strong>2,834 informal patients</strong> in adult mental health wards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">But the majority of patients was detained under the Mental Health Act with 6,408 at the end of May 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">Someone can be detained if professionals think their mental health puts them or others at risk. They can be taken to hospital and be kept there against their wishes.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-7">At the end of May 2021, detained patients made up <strong>69%</strong> of the total inpatient count.</a></p>

        </div>

        <h3>Why is high number of detained patients a problem?</h3>
        <p>With the lack of beds and the difficulties accessing inpatient care, those who are in hospital at the moment, are considerably unwell, AMHP says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“The acuity of people on wards is severe at the moment – it means that everybody is unwell, disturbed or distressed.”</blockquote>
        <p>AMHP draws up two scenarios. One where 50 per cent of patients on the ward are detained and 50 per cent are there voluntarily. He would imagine the latter to be less unwell and less distressed.</p>
        <p>In the other scenario, 85 per cent of people on the wards are detained and severely unwell.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“That’s a very difficult place for other people to be and live in. You might have people very distressed, showing positive symptoms of mental disorder, responding to voices, and being actively suicidal. Staff might have to intervene and do restraints and forced medication. You wouldn’t describe that as a therapeutic environment.”</blockquote>
        <p>In 2011, a report by the charity <strong>MIND</strong> <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4377/listening_to_experience_web.pdf">has found that 39 per cent of people in hospital were detained under the Mental Health Act</a>.</p>
        <p>“This suggests that NHS psychiatric hospitals are increasingly used to care for and contain people who are seriously mentally ill and who are considered to pose a risk to themselves or others.” (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2011b)</p>

        <p>other vis: In some trusts the number of detained patients is even higher/the ratio of detained patients is even higher.</p>

        <h3>What happens when there isn’t a bed?</h3>
        <p>When no bed is available for a patient, … (patient is treated at home?/ in the community)</p>
        <p>From Helen’s experience, the team would work closely with an individual to produce an appropriate/suitable care package. </p>
        <p>That could be home treatment going in regularly, it could be the use of the crisis team who can provide a response, or it could be thinking about some of the Talking Therapies and helping someone access them.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think the most important thing we would do is provide that therapeutic relationship, that acknowledgment that we are there for that individual, that unconditional positive regard as well as advocating for them and pushing for the access to the services they need.”</blockquote>
        <p>However, Helen is experiencing restrictions on what she can do on a community-basis. This is mainly due to an increased demand for community services with referrals going up significantly. </p>
        <p>“The referrals are so overwhelming at the moment,” Helen says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I'm probably telling ideal world scenarios– kind of what would happen in an ideal world. Whether people would actually get that in reality would depend on how busy the particular service was where they lived.”</blockquote>
        <p>Hannah has experienced stretched community services.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s hard to get help initially and then it’s hard to keep that help. Everything is time-limited and you sort of move from service to service. There is definitely not enough support in the community at all.”</blockquote>

        <p>data: referrals going up</p>

But it can give an impression of /show a trend of how many people are homeless and therefore in need of housing support.
