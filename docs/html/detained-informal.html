        <p>An analysis of how available beds, occupancy rates and the ratio of detained to informal patients in mental health inpatient services is affecting patient care and the accessiblity of services</p> <!--Available beds, occupancy rates and ratio of detained to informal patients impact/influence patient care and the accessiblity of services. To a point where community mental health nurse Helen Rees says: “There are times where we have to sit with the knowledge that what we are offering is not the optimum for that individual. So we know that they're likely to get more unwell. We know that they're likely to experience distress. It feels really hard. Really hard.”-->

      <p><em>Trigger warning &mdash; this post discusses suicidal feelings</em></p>
      <p>When Hannah* was detained under the Mental Health Act last year, she was put in a Section 136 suite until a bed became available.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">“I wasn’t on a 136, but there were no beds, so they had to put me in a 136 which is like a cell basically. It’s just got a plastic bed and they took all my clothes off me and put me in ligature proof clothes, and it got a little camera in the corner. It was horrible. I had to stay there for 24 hours because there were no beds.”<br><div class="source"></div></blockquote>
      <p>A Section 136 suite is used for people detained by the police under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It is supposed to provide a place of safety while assessments are carried out.</p>
      <p>But Hannah was detained under a <strong>Section 2</strong> &mdash; used if someone needs to be detained for a short time for assessment and medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Because there were no beds, she was put in the Section 136 Suite. When a bed was finally found, it was out of her area.</p>

      <p>Since 1988, the number of mental health beds has decreased by <strong>74 per cent</strong>.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956136"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-1">In 1987/1988, <strong>67,122 beds</strong> were available for mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-2">In the following 33 years, the number of beds has fallen by <strong>almost 50,000 beds</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956136/slide-3">In 2020/2021, only on average <strong>17,610 beds</strong> were left.</a></p>

      </div>

      <p>The reduction of mental illness beds largely resulted from a <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/service-transformation">policy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems in the community rather than in institutional settings</a>.</p>
      <p>Since the late 1950s there has been a move away from hospitalising people with mental health problems. Instead, it has been sought to provide care through multidisciplinary teams based in the community while people live in their own homes.</p>
      <p>This led to large-scale closures of inpatient mental health beds in the mid- to late-1980s.</p>

      <h3>Operating on high bed occupancy rates</h3>

      <p>On average, every day <strong>82 per cent</strong> of these beds were <strong>occupied</strong> in 2020/2021.</p>

      <p>To maintain patient safety standards, <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10288-001-Emergency-admissions.pdf">bed occupancy should not exceed 85 per cent</a>. A higher bed occupancy leads to regular bed shortages. These are impacting patient care as directing patients to the bed most suitable for their care is less likely to be possible.</p>

      <p>Data obtained through Freedom of Information requests reveals that while the national average was below 85 per cent, individual mental health trusts are <strong>operating at higher occupancy rates</strong>.</p>

      <!-- Flourish scrollytelling -->
      <div id=”my-wrapper”>
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="85vh" data-src="story/956231"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-1">Out of 36 trusts that replied to the request in time, only six trusts had bed occupancy rates <strong>below</strong> 85 per cent at the end of June 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-2">30 trusts had rates <strong>over</strong> 85 per cent.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-3">This means the majority of trusts was operating at levels that should not be exceeded to maintain patient safety standards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-4">Out of the trusts exceeding the recommended occupancy rates, six trusts had rates ranging between 85 and 90 per cent.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-5">In 11 trusts, between 90 and 95 per cent of beds were occupied by mental health patients.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-6">In nine trusts almost all beds were occupied.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-7">And in four trusts bed occupancy even <strong>exceeded 100 per cent</strong> &mdash; meaning some beds were occupied by more than one patient that day.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/956231/slide-8">This happens when one patient is on leave and during that time the bed is given to a new patient, says Approved Mental Health Professional Tahir.</a></p>

      </div>


        <h3>What the lack of beds means for detentions</h3>
        <p>If there is no bed available, then a patient cannot be detained, says <strong>Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP)</strong> Tahir who does not want his real name to be known.</p>
        <p>AMHPs are trained to use the Mental Health Act. They carry out assessments and help decide if someone should be detained.</p>
        <p>“The tricky thing is the AMHP can’t make the application to detain a patient until the NHS tells the AMHP where the bed is,” Tahir says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“If there is no bed, they are not detained. No one is detained until the AMHP makes the application.<p>“This means the person is free to go about their business. And that’s a real problem sometimes.”</p></blockquote>
        <p>For example, if Tahir accesses someone in their home but cannot detain them because of a lack of beds, he has to come back later and ask them to let him back in since he has no power of entry.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“How would you feel about that? I’m telling you I’m going to detain you but I have to leave, so please let me back in later and until then keep yourself safe and don’t bother anybody.<p>“It doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t feel ideal. I always describe the system as being dysfunctional and difficult to navigate.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Beds are increasingly allocated based on patients' risks</h3>
        <p>Every mental health trust has a <strong>bed manager</strong> who knows how many people are being assessed and waiting to come in. </p>
        <p>“They will rate the risk of people and they will prioritise the beds to those that they consider to be the most at risk to themselves or others,” Tahir says.</p>

        <!-- image Helen -->

          <img src="../images/Helen-Rees-image.jpg" width="100%" alt="A photograph of community mental health nurse Helen Rees">
          <figcaption>Community mental health nurse Helen Rees. Photo by Helen Rees.</figcaption>
        </div>


        <p>“If someone is more risky, they are more likely to get a bed quicker,” is also what <strong>Helen Rees</strong> is experiencing. She is a <strong>mental health nurse</strong> working with 0 to 25-year-olds in the community. </p>
        <p>For her, the lack of beds means that it has gotten harder for informal patients to access inpatient support when they need it. She says: “The service that we are offering is increasingly becoming risk-based management.”</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“You could be really highly distressed and suffering and have an illness that is impacting your life and health outcomes but unless there are significant risks and that kind of threshold is met, getting an inpatient bed is really difficult.”</blockquote>
        <p>As a result, people are being left without inpatient support for longer, Helen says &mdash; until they get into the position where those risks are there. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“We are having to nurse people to a point in the community where if they got that level of help earlier then they wouldn't get to that riskier stage. But we are having to let people get to that riskier stage because we just can't access inpatient beds in the way we would like to.”</blockquote>
        <p>The Care Quality Commission <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20180123_mhadetentions_report.pdf">has heard similar reports from trusts</a>:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">We were told that delays in admission due to a bed not being available may mean that a patient, who might have consented to be admitted informally at an earlier stage, may deteriorate and become unwilling or unable to agree to an admission, and therefore need to be detained under the MHA.</blockquote>

        <h3>How a lack of beds impacts admissions</h3>
        <p>With the lack of beds and the difficulties accessing inpatient care, those who are in hospital at the moment are considerably unwell, Tahir says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“The acuity of people on wards is severe at the moment – it means that everybody is unwell, disturbed or distressed.”</blockquote>
        <p>This is impacting all patients on the ward. Tahir draws up two scenarios. One where 50 per cent of patients on the ward are detained and 50 per cent are there voluntarily. He would imagine the latter to be less unwell and less distressed. In the other scenario, 85 per cent of people on the wards are detained and severely unwell.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“That’s a very difficult place for other people to be and live in. You might have people very distressed, showing positive symptoms of mental disorder, responding to voices, and being actively suicidal. Staff might have to intervene and do restraints and forced medication. You wouldn’t describe that as a therapeutic environment.”</blockquote>
        <p>In 2011, a report by the charity <strong>MIND</strong> has found that <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4377/listening_to_experience_web.pdf">39 per cent of people in hospital were detained under the Mental Health Act</a>.</p>
        <p>Back then <strong>NHS Digital</strong> said in their <a href="https://files.digital.nhs.uk/publicationimport/pub02xxx/pub02179/ment-heal-bull-four-repo-m-h-m-d-2010-rep.pdf">Mental Health Bulletin</a>: “This suggests that NHS psychiatric hospitals are increasingly used to care for and contain people who are seriously mentally ill and who are considered to pose a risk to themselves or others.”</p>
        <p>Ten years later, the ratio of detained patients in wards is <strong>considerably higher</strong>.</p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-1">At the end of May 2021, <strong>22,113 patients</strong> were inpatient in adult mental health wards in England.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-2">The majority of patients was admitted to <strong>NHS hospitals</strong>. Just over 5,000 were placed in <strong>private hospitals</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-3">For the purpose of this investigation, we have sent FOI requests to all NHS mental health trusts in England about the number of detained patients in their adult mental health wards. 33 trusts replied in time and provided data.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-3">Based on the data, we can say whether a patient was detained or informal for half of the patients in NHS instituations.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-4">If a patient is in a mental health hospital voluntarily, this is called an <strong>informal admission</strong>.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-5">At the end of May 2021, there were <strong>2,834 informal patients</strong> in adult mental health wards.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">But the majority of patients was <strong>detained under the Mental Health Act</strong> with 6,408 at the end of May 2021.</a></p>

        <p><a href="#story/954111/slide-6">Someone can be detained if professionals think their mental health puts them or others at risk. They can be taken to hospital and be kept there against their wishes.</a></p>

        <h3>Trusts with high detained patient rates</h3>
        <p>In 2018, the <strong>Care Quality Commission</strong> published a <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20180123_mhadetentions_report.pdf">report on the rise in the use of the Mental Health Act to detain people in England</a>.</p>
        <p>They found that some NHS wards would only submit people if they were subject to the Act. With bed occupancy exceeding 100 per cent in some areas, even patients requiring an admission under Section 2 might experience delays.</p>
        <p>The data shows regional differences in the ratio of detained to informal patients on the wards.</p>

        <h3>What happens when there is no bed?</h3>
        <p>When no bed is available for a patient, the responsibility falls to the community teams to care for this patient.</p>
        <p>From Helen’s experience, the team would work closely with an individual to produce a suitable care package. </p>
        <p>That could be that home treatment or crisis teams would go in regularly. It could also be helping someone access Talking Therapies.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think the most important thing we would do is provide that therapeutic relationship, that acknowledgment that we are there for that individual, that unconditional positive regard as well as advocating for them and pushing for the access to the services they need.”</blockquote>
        <p>However, Helen is experiencing restrictions on what she can do on a community-basis. This is mainly due to an increased demand for community services with referrals going up significantly. </p>
        <p>“The referrals are so overwhelming at the moment,” Helen says and adds:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I'm probably telling ideal world scenarios. Whether people would actually get that in reality would depend on how busy the particular service was where they lived.”</blockquote>
        <p>The number of referrals to mental health services have hit their <strong>highest point in two years</strong>. Latest figures by NHS Digital show that between March and May 2021, <strong>over one million new referrals</strong> were made to mental health services.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7019910"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>Hannah knows what it stretched community services and struggling to get the right support feel like.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s hard to get help initially and then it’s hard to keep that help. Everything is time-limited and you sort of move from service to service. There is definitely not enough support in the community at all.”</blockquote>

        <h3>"I was let down by services"</h3>
        <p>Lockdowns, restrictions, and not being able to meet friends. The pandemic has had a big impact on Pavan's mental health. Added to that, he lost someone he knew to suicide in early 2020. When Pavan felt himself getting low, he reached out to his mental health team &mdash; but no additional support was put in place.</p>

        <p>“They felt that I wasn’t at too much of a risk,” Pavan says.</p>

        <p>Over weeks, his mental health detoriated further. In the span of three weeks, he attempted suicide twice. Still, he did not get any extra support from mental health services, he says.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“Despite that distressing episode I had in June 2020, however bad it was, there was just nothing out there for me.”</blockquote>
        <p>After his second attempt, he got taken to hospital.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“This time, it escalated straight to the police getting involved. I was taken to a general hospital and kept there on 1:1 monitoring because of concerns for my welfare.”</blockquote>

        <p>After one week, Pavan got discharged, feeling slightly better, he says. Today, he is not feeling suicidal or in crisis. But he is still waiting for help from services, he says: "I continued living with minimal to no support."</p>

        <p>He would have wanted regular sessions with the mental health team.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">“Barely anything was put in. I was quite let down. I don’t think I would have gotten to the point of getting hospitalised if I was given the right support.”</blockquote>

        <h3>Patients sent home to wait for an admission</h3>
        <p>If no bed is available, it can be that a patient is sent home until a bed comes up.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Hannah agreed to be admitted informally &mdash; but because there was no bed available, she was sent back to her flat where she was living on her own. </p>
        <p>“I've ended up waiting for days for a bed at home,” she says and adds: “And that's just once you've made the decision that you agree to the admission.”</p>
        <p>Finding hospitals difficult, it was a big deal for Hannah to agree to go in informally. Being told that no bed is available and sent back home to wait, made the situation even harder for her. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It was horrible. Obviously you're acutely unwell and you're completely in it and the stress of saying yes, I will go in when you don't really want to go in and then suddenly having that weight of just waiting.<p>“Usually they put you under the crisis team and the crisis team visits you every day, but that's half an hour out of a day and the rest of the time is just like sitting, waiting for the call to say that there’s a bed and not knowing where that bed will be as well.” </p></blockquote>

        <h3>Trusts not operating admission waiting lists</h3>
        <p>The majority of trusts do not operate a waiting list for admissions. Out of 36 trusts that replied to a FOI about this matter, only <strong>eight trusts (22 per cent)</strong> are operating a waiting list. At the end of June 2021, 351 patients in these trusts were waiting for a bed. </p>
        <p>The longest time a patient on the lists has been waiting for an admission was <strong>288 days</strong> in <strong>Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust</strong>. On average, patients in that trust have been waiting 28 days for a bed.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust</strong>, one patient has already been waiting for <strong>272 days</strong> &mdash; 2.5 times the average waiting time of 111 days.</p>
        <p>The shortest waiting times have been recorded in <strong>Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust</strong> where patients have been waiting on average 3 hours until they got admitted.</p>
        <p>Trusts that were not able to report on this data often said that a bed will be found when a person needs to be admitted &mdash; and therefore no waiting list is required. <strong>Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust</strong> referred to their Crisis Response Home Treatment Teams that can support patients in the community.</p>
        <p>Trusts admitted that “patients will occasionally be placed out of area if no bed is available locally”.</p>
        <p>This is despite the national ambition of eliminating inappropriate Out of Area Placements by the end of March 2021 &mdash; a deadline that has passed by now.</p>
        <p>Despite this, 440 patients were newly placed out of their area in May 2021 because no local beds were available.</p>
        <p>After Hannah has spent 24 hours in the Section 136 suite, a bed was found for her. But, the bed was not in her usual area.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that she was sent out of area for treatment, an experience that was stressful for her.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“It was incredibly stressful because they take you in secure transport. You’re already a mess and then suddenly you're put in this car and with these security guards and just suddenly taken, randomly. You’re told where you’re going but you can’t really visualise where you’re going.”</blockquote>



        <h3>More beds, more staff, more early intervention</h3>
        <p>When Helen talks about her role, she describes reducing coercion and restriction and co-producing care as key parts. Not being able to provide the right support at the right time leads to a risk of <strong>moral injury</strong>, she says. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think that because we can't get beds when people are willing to go informally, there's a real risk of moral injury there because we can't support people in the way that we would like to &mdash; which would be in a least coercive, informal way.”</blockquote>
        <p>Moral injury leads in part to high turnover of staff which in turn affects the delivered care. </p>
        <p>Therefore, Helen would like to see community services that are commissioned and designed by nurses and people with lived experience. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“I think you need to ask the people that deliver the care, which is the nurses and the people who receive the care and design some really high quality, well-staffed, well-funded community services that are what people need.”</blockquote>
        <p>By that, Helen specifies, she does not mean home treatment and crisis teams, but services that support patients before they get into a period of distress. </p>
        <p>To reduce restrictive care, Helen says more beds in the NHS are needed. </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">“Trusts need to have a responsibility not to place people out of areas and to do that, they need to access beds. And I'm completely committed to people receiving care in the community. That is what we would all want and that's what patients want when it's safe to do so. <p>But we can't avoid the fact that not everybody can stay well through community services alone. Some people are going to need inpatient care in order to stay well and they can't do that unless there are more beds.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>A job that has become more challenging</h3>
        <p>Tahir has been working as an AMHP for <strong>over 20 years</strong>. When he started his job, there were more beds and more provision. </p>

        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s a privilege to be invited into people’s lives at sometimes the lowest point. Sometimes people like me literally save your life. It doesn’t feel like that, but we actually save people’s lives. And sometimes we fail.”</blockquote>
        <p>Over time, the job has become more challenging. “It’s hugely frustrating at times because it feels as if you’re fighting against the system,” Tahir says.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">“It’s the lack of provision, it’s the lack of early intervention, it’s the lack of tackling the social determinants of health, it’s the lack of beds, it’s the lack of investment &mdash; it’s mental health services being underinvested in for decades and decades. And it cannot meet the demand that has been placed upon it.” </blockquote>

        <p class="data-infobox"><strong>About the data:</strong> (source: FOI to NHS Trusts…) + Not all services are required to record the patient's accommodation status. This is why the number of unknown/unrecorded accommodation type is high. The data therefore cannot provide a full picture of the housing situation of people in contact with adult mental health services. But it can give an impression of /show a trend of how many people are homeless and therefore in need of housing support. Rather/in fact/on the contrary, the number of those in need of housing support because of unsuitable living conditions is likely to be higher - since not all trusts record the data.</p> -->
