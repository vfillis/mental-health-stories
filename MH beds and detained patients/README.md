The story was based on data from different sources. 

**1. Available mental illness beds**

NHS England publishes [data on available mental illness beds](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/). This includes a time series from 1987. 

The data used in the story can be found [here]().

**4. Referrals to mental health services**

Data on referrals to mental health services is part of the [Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics/performance-may-provisional-june-2021). 

I downloaded the CSV files from April 2019 to May 2021 (as this was the latest available data) and have merged them using the command line. I then analysed the data in R. The script can be found [here](). 

The final data can be found [here]().
