# Weekly charts around mental health data 

As part of my newsletter I will analyse and visualise data around mental health services. 

This is data I have analysed so far: 

- inappropriate Out of Area Placements in mental health services
- waiting times for referrals with eating disorder issues for those aged 0-18
