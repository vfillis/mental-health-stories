# Weekly charts around mental health data 

As part of my newsletter I will analyse and visualise data around mental health services. 

My aim is to provide an insight into the accessibility and state of NHS mental health services through official data releases as well as Freedom of Information requests. 

Results and visualisations will be published on Instagram, Twitter and my weekly newsletter. 

So far, I have looked at the following issues:

- Inappropriate Out of Area Placements in mental health services
- Waiting times for referrals with eating disorder issues for those aged 0-18 
- The recruitment of new nursing staff in mental health services 
- Rising detentions under the Mental Health Act
